Images, their component colors. Playing around with them.

I set up a Gradio space in HuggingFace. First I set up the functions in my local VS Code, late I wrote the same in HuggingFace. In my VS Code, the ordering of the channels is Blue(0), Green (1), Red (2). Whle in the Gradio space, the ordering is Red (0), Blue (1), Green (2). It's weird to me for now.
