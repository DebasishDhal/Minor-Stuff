# Notes
- If I find two german names for a place name, I keep the german name that is more similar to its corresponding X language. Same goes for the other way around.
- German-Slovak dataset - I've done less than 5 manual edits in the csv file after creating them.
- German-Czech dataset - Around 50 manual edits done by me in the csv file.
- German-Slovene dataset - Around 20 manual edits done by me in the csv file.
